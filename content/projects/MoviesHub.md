Movies Hub is a website that displays movies that are available on the tv amaze API and displays them in the home page cards, It contains pop-up windows showing more details of the movie and people's reviews or comments on the movie allowing also another user to add his or her own review. It was developed using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Developed by me with microverse colleague.
